But I understand why the fire department said that it couldn&apos;t be a student space. &#10;Hearing my friend talk about their experience as a person with a disability was eye opening and gave me a new perspective to think about.&#10;We took action by planing to put period products, and the wastebaskets to go along with them, in the male restroom for the guys in our community who have periods.&#10;I learned a little bit more on how to take action and how to speak up for people in my community who require things to be safe and to feel good.&#10;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d change anything.
