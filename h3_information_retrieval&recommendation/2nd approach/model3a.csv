It was also really great to see Nevera behave with a costume on and with the kid that was on her.&#10;After our group ride we all ate dinner and talked about the history behind halloween and a little bit of the brain science behind why people like being scared. Then the older group stayed behind to close the barn.&#10;I learned more about the history behind halloween and how it has some origin from Ireland.

It could likely support a few hundred pounds of grape vine with ease.&#10;I used a pair of garden clippers to cut some large weeds, and I built a grape vine trellis, using various tools such as hammers and drills to aid in the process.&#10;I learned the design of a Modified Munson grape trellis, and how it is used to farm grapes.&#10;Everything went well. The grape vine trellis we built turned out great, and I wouldn&apos;t do anything different.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I created an email flyer for an announcement for the yearbook, compiling information into a pretty flyer that contained all the information in an easy-to-understand format. I also reached out to the Director of Communications, asking for her to announce the flyer I made that told the results of the cover contest&apos;s winners.&#10;During this experience, I felt creative and thoughtful, and then once I was finished I felt proud of my work. I always get a little nervous having to reach out to people, so I felt a little anxious in the process of emailing the Director of Communications, but allowed my pride and happiness with my work to overshadow that, and allowing me to have an easy experience reaching out to the Director.&#10;I used technology and resources to create a flyer and I used creativity to take bare-boned information and make it into nice and easy-to-understand blurbs that made it an announcement. I used critical thinking to adjust my format to fit the flyer shape I wanted, as well as to determine if my work was visually pleasing.&#10;I learned how to make a flyer that is capable of being sent out to students and staff announcing the results of the yearbook cover contest, using a unique formatting size for it. I also furthered my understanding of how to use Canva.&#10;Things went well, and in the future, because I am more familiar with the platform and what I want from an announcement flyer, I hope to be more efficient in my work.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also learned how to ride my trainers sons six year old Navajo mustang.&#10;I would have liked to have had a slightly more collecte canter and/or lunged for longer so that she was less willing to take off.

This week collectively I completed seven hours of my AWOL work making preemie hats. I sat and watched my favorite TV show and crocheted. I started and completed about four hats. Three were 1-3 lbs ones and the other was 3-5 lbs sized. I finished one ball of yarn (pink) and started another (pale grey).&#10;I was happy and calm while I crocheted. It was nice to destress for a while and do something that was important for me as well as good for my mental health.&#10;I made four preemie hats three of which were 1-3 lbs size and pink. The other was 3-5 lbs size and pale grey. I sewed the ends in each of them so that they are ready to be washed when it&apos;s time.&#10;I continue to learn how important this project is to me and how much it affects my mental health in a positive way.&#10;I thought this week was very successful and I wouldn&apos;t do anything differently.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I set up before my school&apos;s literature group, putting the tables in a circle and handing out rubrics, as well as making sure every student had their work prepared. I facilitated conversation by posing thoughtful questions about the reading, helped others share their own thoughts, and invited everyone to participate. I also looked over their short constructed responses to the reading and marked them up for grammar or content issues, leaving recommendations and compliments.&#10;During the seminar, I was proud of the conversation that the students were having and was happy to see that their conversation was starting to include considering the author and plot, rather than just discussing what happened in the book. When looking over SCRs I felt productive, and overall I was proud. Their SCRs, across the board, have improved dramatically, and while I had some students who simply seem to not learn from any of their mistakes and I feel a little frustration, that emotion was overshadowed by continued pride h=at having students improve on their SCRs.&#10;I took leadership in the seminar, leading my peers through meaningful conversation while also being self-aware enough to keep myself from dominating the conversation, allowing others to develop their own thoughts and share them with the group. I also was able to be critical and review people&apos;s SCRs for grammatical errors and critique their writing content, making notes to help them improve their writing and literature analytic skills.&#10;I learned that progress isn&apos;t always linear. While I saw great improvement across the board amount the SCRs, today&apos;s seminar and a select few of the SCRs went back on previous improvements: some SCRs were out of MLA format despite my steps taken to inform the students of MLA format and the conversation had more lulls and moments of no conversation than last time. I have hope they will continue to grow though, and this one day does not mean they haven&apos;t made progress.&#10;In the future, I will prepare more thought-provoking questions to have prepared in case people across the board are allowing for more lulls in conversation. Additionally, one of the teacher&apos;s at my school asked me to speak a little on what content from the book would be good to put in an assignment for an outside class that connects to our literature group by making the students form a connection between the students and the literature group book, and next time I will speak on that.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I felt relived by helping her somewhat conquer that language barrier. I know how hard that can be and I am happy she did not hesitate to call me.&#10;I walked her through the problems step by step. I ensured that she understood the assignment before leaving her house.&#10;I learned that no matter who asks for help to help them because I learned that she did know the material she just struggled with the order of the steps. I also learned that everyone struggles somewhere and if you push them they will succeed and do good.&#10;I do not think I would do anything differently. She knew she could count on me and that she could call me if she ever needed help.,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my friends had a birthday and I took the responsibility of baking a German fruit cake. I spent 2.5 hours baking and assembling the cake.&#10;I was happy to be able to help my friends have a good birthday party, as well as being happy to have friends that I can celebrate with.&#10;I assembled the cake by first baking the biscuit, then biking to the store to get some ingredients while letting it cool, then adding coconut cream to the middle layer. I then added pudding, cut strawberries, and blackberries to the top.&#10;I learned that it is a good idea to have the ingredients beforehand when baking something. I am happy as to the timing of my excursion as it allowed the cake to cool properly.&#10;I would have liked to have gotten the toppings needed when biking to karate class, so that I would not have had to leave during the creation of the cake.

Me and my fellow coaches for the frisbee team had to decide what devision we wanted to play in for our fall tourney. During this we had to evaluate everyones individual skills as well as our whole teams capability. We wanted to allow proper experience to the new players while allowing the experienced players to advance more.&#10;We all felt worried about making the wrong decision for our team. It also became stressful when I realized that the fate of our season could fall into my hands.&#10;We planned how to advance in the next couple of weeks so that we can play the highest devision. We also began endurance training during practice. We played another game to see how we are advancing.&#10;I learned that I must keep a steady head for the team and not just do as I would wish. I must take charge of any responsible injuries and loses that we may have coming up since I made the decision to advance us all.&#10;I would not do anything different.

"I looked through potential themes for the yearbook, marking down a list of themes I think would work well for this year&apos;s yearbook for future reference with the yearbook team and supervisor. I emailed my school&apos;s director of communications at the prompting of my supervisor, asking her to add the link to my website to a yearbook announcement she had made as well as another announcement for the upcoming ordering of the yearbooks. I prompted myself to create two flyers, as well as planning to create more in the future, that spread awareness for the average student&apos;s ability to submit their own photos to potentially be in the yearbook through the yearbook website that I designed in the past.&#10;I was working at a fast pace, finding my grove in the work for yearbook tasks that need to be being completed, creating the feeling of working hard without overworking myself leaving me feeling proud and productive. I used my own critical thinking and creativeness to look through potential yearbook themes as well as applying it to the flyers that I made during A.W.O.L. and it made me feel artsy and creative as well as productive.&#10;I used analysis and critical thinking as I shortened a list of potential yearbook themes from over 300 to a list of 11 as well as designing thoughtful, eye-catching and informative flyers for photo submissions to the yearbook. I used good communication skills through all three of my tasks, thinking about how to best communicate to my future self about what themes were my favorites, what I needed from the director of communications, as well as how best to easily communicate to students and staff how they could best submit photos through the website I previously created. I also used self-direction and problem solving after my agenda for the day was complete but I still had work time, as I saw an issue (the lack of use of my photo submission forms on the yearbook website) and found a solution to the problem through flyers to spread awareness.&#10;I learned further how to use my resources to create flyers that are concise but informative. I furthered my skills of writing emails to others and asking them to communicate through their resources to my target audience. And, I also learned how to better fill my undirected time with productive and gratifying work that both myself and and my supervisor can find useful and interesting.&#10;Things went well today, and I will continue to use critical thinking to look for gaps where work needs to be done for something that I am becoming increasingly passionate about.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Last week, I took my partner shopping. We first went to a curiosity shop then went to an antique shop where the owner gave me clothes to mend. Lastly, I took them home for them to try on clothes from a certain sub-style of an alternative fashion.&#10;I felt nervous about my partner when they wanted to buy something since it almost became an impulse purchase. I felt stressed about mending the clothes since it was my first time mending something for a company. Lastly, I felt proud for my partner trying out a sub-style of alternative fashion that they always wanted to do.&#10;I drove my partner to the places they wanted to go to. Secondly, I took the clothes and finished mending the clothes. Thirdly, I helped my partner create a thought process in case they want to purchase something. Lastly, I lend the clothes for my partner to try on.&#10;I learned that my partner likes to dress similar to a modern idea of a casual pirate. I also learned that they constantly change the radio station while I was driving. I learned that Cold Stone is not creative with its seasonal special ice cream flavor (this year is cake batter dyed black). Lastly, I learned that the antique store trusts me a little too much to fix their stock.&#10;I would definitely change the radio somehow so it would stay mute. I would change the rate I charged for the clothes.

"On Friday, I went fabric shopping with my brother. Earlier this summer, I made a tennis skirt, and my brother wanted me to make him a custom-sized one (since skirt sizes do not accommodate those who have wider body types). Throughout Saturday and Sunday, I sewed the skirt.&#10;I was frustrated with the fabric company that my brother and I were shopping at since there were not a lot of natural fiber selections for us to chose from. I got temporary mad at him because I was planning to buy something for myself, then he bought it for me. I do not remember the emotions I felt when I was making the skirt, since I went into a flow focus for the entire process.&#10;I helped my brother select a fabric store to go to. I gave him a mini-lesson on how to read fabric bolts. I also finished making the skirt in two days.&#10;1: Fabric stores can be overwhelming to newcomers. 2: Plans for selecting fabric can feel like a massive decision. 3: Fabric stores have massive sales in October.&#10;1: I would&apos;ve asked my brother if he would&apos;ve wanted to look at other fabric stores to look at bigger selections. 2: I would&apos;ve suggested a different zipper. 3: I would&apos;ve asked if we could&apos;ve gotten food.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Over the summer my parents separated and split houses. At this point I was busy traveling on a month long road trip all over the North-West side of America.

I also continued teaching basic skills to prepare for our winter donations!&#10;I definitely began to feel frustrated leading up to the ending time due to the lack of participation and effort but I will say that I saw some growth in students I wasn&apos;t expecting and that made the experience much more tolerable and enjoyable. I did have fun watching my kids try their hands at ceramics, and the fact they cleaned up after themselves made my day that much easier.&#10;I gave the struggling kids an ultimatum: they can learn ceramics with Emmy and properly engage or they can do craft stuff with me in preparation for winter. I also made my kids step up more during clean up time which went very well. The last thing I spent my time doing outside of school was continuing to finish up my 3 hats and a sweater I&apos;m working on.&#10;I learned that I might need to broaden my class with a skill that takes less time to develop and learn to wrangle in the difficult kids. I also learned that talking one-on-one with them really helped to establish goals and deadlines personalized to their availability and project. I also learned in term of projects, I need to complete them before I start new ones.&#10;I would definitely try introducing another activity that takes less skill but is still necessary so kids feel more open to trying them. I also would&apos;ve met with the kids sooner about their individual goals and deadlines, although it&apos;s worked out just fine thus far. Furthermore, I want to keep my kids concise on deadlines which means setting a good example and finishing my own projects before beginning new ones.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Since the instructor for our elective was absent, she sent us links to watch documentaries that featured historical moments of civil rights issues. The group and I chose a documentary titled, Crip Camp. Which was about a children&apos;s summer camp that was created for children with disabilities.&#10;The documentary was very good. I liked how there was an abundant amount of footage of the summer camp. The writer did a good job framing the footage between the time (the 1950s to 1970s) and the other protagonists being shown now.&#10;1: I helped picked the documentary. 2: I helped move the computer to places where people were able to watch. 3: I helped a peer move the computer closer to an outlet before it died.&#10;1: I learned that the 504 has only been implemented for 48 years. 2: I learned that the ADA has only been implemented for 31 years. 3: I learned that Judith Heumann was a force to be reckoned with.&#10;1: I would probably bring a speaker if I remembered that the instructor supposes to be absent. 2: I would&apos;ve asked to move the computer to a taller table since the floor tables were slightly uncomfortable. 3: I afterwords helped other students set up chairs for a community meeting for next week.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"With the guidance of my yearbook supervisor, I updated the yearbook website to match current times and events relevant to yearbook.

Today my yearbook supervisor was not present, and so I had to organize on my own with just her instructions of what needed to be completed by the end of A.W.O.L. I also enjoyed organizing both the website and the mood boards, satisfied with how they looked and turned out in the end.&#10;I updated a website with the information given to me without much further instruction.

"My school has literature groups that we participate in every Wednesday, and I volunteered to be one of two leaders for my group. With the help of my co-leader, I facilitated conversation about the most recent chapter section of our assigned book. I prompted people to participate in the conversation, asked questions to further the depth of understanding of the most recent section, and then graded the short constructed responses of those in my group, marking them up for grammar, spelling, structure, MLA formatting, and analysis issues.&#10;Throughout this experience, I felt determined and proud. I am determined, and am taking actions towards encouraging, deeper analysis of the book itself, as well as getting everyone to follow correct MLA format. I was also proud of how much better this round of short constructed responses and conversation flow and depth was than previous rounds, already knowing that the students will continue to grow throughout the year.&#10;I planned and prepared for the literature group seminar by creating questions of my own that would prompt conversation and analysis while also helping to guide students away from issues that my co-leader and I have been noticing during seminar and within short constructed responses. I guided and facilitated conversation and analysis of our assigned book, with the prepared direction and purpose. I also marked up the short constructed responses of the students, marking grammar and spelling issues, MLA formatting issues, analysis development issues, as well as marking where each student did well and should continue to replicate the thoughtful developments they wrote.&#10;I learned more about facilitating a guided conversation as well as leading thoughtful analysis of a topic without spoon-feeding students my own ideas, prompting them to develop their own. I also learned how rewarding seeing growth is in others as a direct result of my own guidance and patience, encouraging me to continue to gently guide others to where they need to be.&#10;This seminar went well, however, next time I will prompt people to come up with their own analysis questions for the group that encourages understanding the meaning behind the book, rather than just asking about and discussing the events of the book.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I felt happy that I was able to encompass this leadership position and help someone who was in the same situation as me.&#10;I communicated with the student. I left my work to find her. I helped her navigate the building.&#10;I learned the importance of communication. I also learned how much of a privilege it is to be comfortable in the space you are in and to be able to navigate it.&#10;I would not do anything differently.,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also demonstrated creativity by thinking about how photos should be taken to reflect the atmosphere of the event.&#10;I learned how to better take photos of a large and moving setting that is continually changing. I learned how to better recognize where there&apos;s a good setting and perspective for photographs even in a moving environment. I learned how to advocate for myself by asking people if I can take photos of them and asking people politely to move out of my way so I can get good quality photos for the yearbook.&#10;Next time, I would make sure that people involved in running special events, such as the pepper eating contest, know I&apos;m taking photos of the yearbook so they can gather winners for a group photo, rather than just having the winners run off after the event is finished and not having the ability to document who the winner was.

"Over the course of teaching my Crafts for Service class, I have run into multiple behavioral problems with certain students. While this is to be expected, my lack of being an adult makes establishing authority much more difficult. Thus, there were kids leaving the class early as well as consistently bringing up inappropriate topics.&#10;I felt extremely frustrated as I felt I had done my absolute best to cater to all of the kids&apos; needs and it wasn&apos;t seeming to work with all of them. My frustration turned to anger when one of the students decided to spontaneously leave without permission, threatening both his and my positions. This made me feel both angry and guilty.&#10;I spoke with both the counselor and the high school AWOL administrator to come up with a plausible solution that wouldn&apos;t tarnish the student&apos;s grades or reputation, it would simply provide an ultimatum (contract) with the child&apos;s best interest in mind.&#10;I learned a whole lot more patience as well as how to practically and quickly set your boundaries and authority.

I learned how to use a new photo editing program to edit the potential yearbook cover art and a photo I took previously that will be used for the yearbook later in the year.

"During diversity this week we watched a version of Alice in Wonderland by a theater company called Phamaly. The actors in Phamaly are all people with disabilities. Phamaly&apos;s mission is to allow people with disabilities to act. I really liked how they did the show.&#10;I was a little bit frustrated and annoyed since we got the audio description version. That means that everything happening on the stage is being narrated. The reason I was annoyed is that it was harder to understand, but it helped me understand what it&apos;s like to have to use that. I was frustrated because we had someone who could have used a closed captions accommodation instead of a voice narration.&#10;I watched the play.&#10;I learned what it&apos;s like to have plays or movies narrated to you. The reason people would need that is if they are blind. It was interesting, but it would&apos;ve had more use in our group if it was closed captions.&#10;I personally wouldn&apos;t do anything differently.

"I volunteered at a farm within my community, helping the farmer with chores around the farm. First, we moved a tree that had fallen down. Later, we built a smoker. The smoker consisted of a metal cylinder that contained a wood fire, a metal pipe which the smoke traveled through, and a chamber which would hold the foods to be smoked. We buried the metal pipe underground so the smoke would cool down to about 100 degrees before it reached the chamber.&#10;The smoker we built turned out great. The smoke was exactly the right temperature once it reached the chamber. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an easy task building the smoker because we had to move giant heavy bricks, but the hard work was well worth it in the end.&#10;I helped move a fallen tree, move heavy bricks, build a smoker using those bricks, and dug a metal tube underground.&#10;I didn&apos;t learn anything new from this experience.

"I guided a literature group seminar as a literature group leader. I helped to facilitate the open flow of constructive conversation among those in the literature group, prompting people to speak and helping to keep there from being too long of a lull in conversation.&#10;I felt prepared, organized, and calm throughout the experience. I knew what to do going into the seminar, what needed to be discussed, what my job would be in facilitating conversation, and what the goal of the seminar was, helping me to feel collected and prepared. Because I felt prepared and I&apos;m not uncomfortable in positions of leadership when I know what is expected of myself and others, I was able to feel calm throughout the experience, helping others who were possibly nervous about sharing at the seminar to feel more relaxed as well.&#10;I prompted and facilitated focused conversation on our literature group book (The Orphan Collector). I also checked the other students&apos; short constructed responses to the reading for grammar and structuring, making notes of places that need correcting or improvement without grading the responses themselves.&#10;I learned how to better prompt people to speak in possibly unfamiliar situations. I also learned how to recognize and fill a lull in conversation through my own input and questioning without dominating the room and conversation.&#10;I think things went well this time, and in the future, I will continue to be confident and relaxed when leading the seminar to help people be comfortable in the space and in the conversation.

I also learned that I know past concepts better than I thought I did, and am still able to use, apply, and explain information that I learned years ago.&#10;In the future, I would do a better job of reviewing the lesson notes beforehand.

"We discussed many things including: person first language (instead of saying ""autistic person,"" saying ""person with autism).

"As part of my AWOL this week, I helped elementary teachers set up new materials in their classroom. One of the materials that I put together was manipulative fractions. This involved taking old fractions off of the shelf and unpacking new ones. I had to clean the new ones and organize them onto shelves.&#10;I had difficulty deciding how to organize the fractions because they were not all standard circular fractions. Some of the fractions were squares or triangular pieces that could be put into a square shape. I ended up asking a third grader to help me because he had done the work before, and I wanted to find a way to include students.&#10;I was careful in unpacking the new materials because they are fragike and I wanted to be cautious with materials that are not mine. I thought back to my own time in elementary and how we were taught to always hold or carry objects with both hands. When I was carrying fractions back and forth, whether new or old, I was careful to carry them gently.&#10;This experience gave me a perspective on things learned at a young age that can be applicable later in life as well. It has been a long time since I have thought to carry something with two hands in such a considerate way.&#10;I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know that I would do anything differently.

"For AWOL, our group discussed upcoming events that are based around creators that are either LGBTQ+ or have a disability.

We then finished off our discussions with possible inclusivity for our school&apos;s bathrooms by eventually getting more inclusive signs and placing menstruation hygiene products in the men&apos;s room.&#10;To start, I was excited to learn about events that mainly included members of the LGBTQIA+ community and events for ones that have a disability.

However, in the end, I felt very hopeful that we could start the process of making the bathrooms more inclusive for everyone.&#10;1: I gave my perspective on the stim room not being possible due to the surrounding environment.&#10;2: I gave the instructor the idea to place menstrual hygiene products in the men&apos;s restroom.&#10;3: I gave an idea for a social experiment where peers would consent to a day with hearing loss.&#10;1: I learned that the fire department didn&apos;t want students to use a closet.&#10;2: I learned how the bathrooms could be more inclusive.&#10;3: I didn&apos;t know there was a dedicated art wall in CO for artist part of the LGBTQ+ community.&#10;I noticed that some peers didn&apos;t talk often. Moving forward I hope to be able to make space for those that do not talk often. Then hopefully everyone in the group will be able to get their perspectives and ideas.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Today I carefully looked at each of the clean preemie hats to see if I needed to repair or cut any loose strings. Then I organized the hats by color and then by size. I attached a handwritten note to each of them and wrote the size of the specific hat on the back. After I had finished preparing the hats I put them into a sealed bag and I wrote a letter to the Tiny Hats for Tiny Babies organization. Soon I will have them fully packaged and ready to send off.&#10;I had a good time preparing the hats. They are all neat and organized and I&apos;m excited I&apos;m so close to donating another round of hats that could save a preemie&apos;s life!&#10;I prepared preemie hats to be packaged and donated.&#10;I learned how much I truly love doing this work and how much I appreciate the people who created the Tiny Hats for Tiny Babies organization!&#10;It went really well!,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After the accident happened I guided my team to a respectful and comfortable end to the game.&#10;I learned how to act and assist in accidents as well as how I truly will need to coach during games bot just in practices. I hope that my team will be able to advance further and enjoy their time just as I enjoy my time playing frisbee.&#10;Since our time was ended early is is hard for me to say I would do anything different.

I spent about 5 and a half hours at the barn and was able to ride my lease horse in my lesson which I hadn&apos;t done in a while. I also did grain bags and did a training lunge with a project pony.&#10;It was nice to ride a horse that I had already figured out and was well trained. It made me realise how much I really would miss him when he leaves with his owner in October. But I was also really happy with how lunging the pony went as she didn&apos;t have any freak-out moments.&#10;I made enough grain bags to ensure that I wouldn&apos;t need to do them the following week and that I would be there when they needed to be re-filled. I also began learning my patterns for the next show. I stayed a little late untacking a horse for my trainer so she could leave.&#10;I learned more about the horses I was and would be working with. I learned more about what would be happening the following weeks and the show. I also learned more about how I would have time for my future lease horse.&#10;I wish I had thought to see if tack needed to be cleaned. It also would have been more helpful if I had brought the side rains to the arena. Also if the vet hadn&apos;t shown up without notice we would have planed more accordingly.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Me, some of my peers, and a teacher were planning out how to create a self regulation room for my high school. We had to make plans on how to utilize a room for this purpose and make sure the other teachers of the highschool were ok with us using this room.&#10;I was excited and a little nervous because I know that if we were to succeed in getting to use the room for the self regulation area it would be very beneficial to many students including myself. I was also nervous because I&apos;m worried that the high school teachers will veto our idea for using that room.&#10;I worked out some of the roadblocks and issues for using that room with my peers. We also proposed our idea to the teachers and now are waiting for the fire department to tell us if it would be ok to use that room since it is pretty small.&#10;What I learned from this experience is that working out problems and brainstorming with peers can be really helpful when trying to solve a problem.&#10;I don&apos;t think I would do anything differently.

"I went to court for the first time. I was a bit nervous because I thought the number of hours I have to do per week would be too much and I would be able to complete my internship. When I got to court and actually got to talk to my supervisor and learned a little more about what I would be doing over the course of my internship I felt a bit more relief. The first day was spent with me, my supervisor, my group leader, and another CU Denver student in court for about 2 hours. Here I was able to learn how to search for DUI cases, what type of information to record, how to input data in the spreadsheet, and what courtrooms to go into. Due to the fact I needed to complete the right hours per week and the civil cases were finished, I ended up going up to the criminal court to get more experience and learn more on how to observe. I didn&apos;t take notes while doing this but I got to see how other cases were handled and got a sense of how the court worked. Overall I had a great first day.&#10;I had a bit of anxiety when I first got to the courthouse as well as fear so my heart was racing a bit. I was really nervous because I wasn&apos;t 100% clear on what would be happening and if I would like my internship. I also felt tired because it was eight-thirty in the morning .&#10;I decided to show up early to calm down a bit as well as ask lots of questions when my supervisor got there.&#10;I learned that although things may seem scary when they are new, no matter what you always learn something and there is always a bright side.

I began my first coding class and learned about the reason we are being taught coding by our teacher at highschool. We will be creating a website for a dance studio for deaf and disabled children. I was very intrigued as coding seems like a cool thing to understand and its for a good cause.&#10;I initially felt very excited to learn how to code. I also felt anxious because learning how to code is a very difficult process. I also felt happy that we were contributing to a good cause.&#10;I began by learning how to code a very bare bones website front page. I learned how to code mainly in HTML and CSS the first day.&#10;I learned how to code in HTML and CSS. I also learned a few items of how to code in HTML.&#10;IF i was to do anything differently I would&apos;ve looked more into the cause of what i was learning to code for.

I also learned that it helps for someone to speak up and start the conversation about mental health and when someone does, the conversation gets far.&#10;I would word it differently and take a little more thought into how I said it.

"I joined a local CrossFit gym in May, and have been doing my best to attend since then, and have made very large gains in my strength and endurance.&#10;This experience has tested me both mentally, and physically, but overall it has made me feel great in all aspects of my life.&#10;I joined my gym, opened myself up to feedback, as well as learning and trying new skills.&#10;I have learned that in some situations it is best to just go for it, and get started with a new hobby, even if it may be scary sometimes.&#10;I wouldn&apos;t do very much differently, other than planning a more consistent workout schedule during the school year which I am currently working on.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I tutored one of my friends in one of her classes. I was teaching her how to work several physics related problems she recently learned and struggled with. I taught her out to figure it out and she came out with a better understanding of it.&#10;It felt good helping others after a year of online and remoteness. It was easier to teach in person and gave me a sense of understanding how everyone learns. No one learns the same way and it felt good knowing I can teacher a subject in many different ways&#10;I spent a couple of hours showing her several formula and formats to solve physics related questions about velocity and distance.&#10;I learned that everyone learns a different way and we need to adapt to their ways of thinking and think outside the box.&#10;It went pretty well. I would just go slower and ask her if she has any additional questions before I stopped tutoring her for the day.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"My mom was drinking hot coffee and brought it to the living room, and had spilt the coffee over the white carpet. And we were panicking trying to figure out what can we do quickly to clean the carpet without having it smell like coffee, or having a dark stain on the carpet.&#10;My thoughts were running I was thinking all at once. Trying to figure out why my mom had reacted the way she did, up until I had saw that she had spilled the coffee.&#10;I was first sitting on the couch when my mom had spilt the coffee. I than quickly got up and saw where the spilt was so I may pick up the cup from the ground before more coffee was spilt. I than quickly rushed to grab towels so I can damp the rug with the towel so it can pick up some coffee. I than went to grab the washing vacuum and prepared it so I may wash the spot before it stains.&#10;I learned that not only if I hadn&apos;t gotten up to help my mom it would&apos;ve been difficult for her to just handle by herself but also there would&apos;ve been a stain on the carpet constantly smelling of coffee all throughout the living room. I also learned because I offered help it was easier when there&apos;s teamwork.&#10;I think what I would&apos;ve done differently was to provide my mom with a tray so she could&apos;ve placed her coffee on the tray rather than on the floor so it could&apos;ve prevented from her spilling the coffee. Or provided her with a table stand so she can easily help my younger sister as well as have her cup of coffee without having it be spilt, I could&apos;ve also served her coffee in a different to-go cup rather than a mug so it wouldn&apos;t spill.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I decided to take care of my physical health, by sleeping early as well as waking up early, and eating a healthy breakfast, containing lots of fruits and vitamins. I also took my vitamins for the day, and I drank a lot of water throughout the day. I would also remind my family to do the same, I would remind my mom to drink more water to prevent dehydration and headaches, as well as remind my sisters to take their vitamins.&#10;My thoughts were that I should do this often. If you take care of your physical health you also take care of your mental health, I learned that sleep, drinking lots of water, and eating healthy as a great effect on a person.&#10;The actions I took were to keep track of my water intake, and made sure I took all of my vitamins for the day, as well as walked outside with my mom and sister whenever the weather was great. I also made sure to go to bed early that way I don&apos;t need my alarm to wake up.&#10;I learned that taking care of your physical health is very important and it has a great effect on yourself and your body. I also learned that if you take care of your physical health you also take care of your mental health, you also feel more energized.&#10;I think what I would differently is not only focus on myself and my own physical health but also my families. I could&apos;ve made breakfast for them so that once they woke up breakfast could&apos;ve been ready for the day and they can eat, which would&apos;ve taken some time off of them.

I went on vacation to Florida and relaxed by myself on the beach and it was very good for my mental health.&#10;I felt very at peace during this experience. Getting away and being near the calm waves and nice sun was very relaxing and helped me destress.&#10;I layed back in the sun and listened to the waves with my eyes closed.

"We are getting a wave of new-hires at Dutch Bros and we do hands-on training during usual shifts.

I then showed her where we kept different supplies and products, how to take different orders, and how to stay organized at the window.&#10;I learned that helping someone can make both them and myself feel accomplished. I also made a new friend at work which is awesome, and she said that she felt a lot less intimidated throughout the day because I offered to help her.&#10;It took me a minute to realize that she was training and that it can be very overwhelming, so I would have made sure to extend a hand at the beginning of the shift, rather than an hour or so in.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I recently moved in with my best friend and his sister, Maddie, who is going through a hard time right now. She is getting divorced from her husband, doesn&apos;t have much money, and has been very stressed. I sat down with her the other day and talked her through a lot and helped her figure out a plan to get back on track and start making some personal growth.&#10;I sympathized for her because I&apos;ve had moments in my life where I&apos;ve been very stressed and felt alone and confused, so I knew I needed to help her. It made me happy to know that I could be there for her and offer insight and comfort.&#10;I sat down and talked through her next steps of action with work, money, relationships, routine, and personal growth. I offered my insight but also offered my ears so that she would know that she has someone here to listen to her.&#10;I learned that sometimes people need help even when they aren&apos;t asking for it. Even if it&apos;s just somebody to talk to, vent to, share ideas with, feel safe and comfortable talking to. It&apos;s important to notice the people around us because we&apos;re all going through our own stuff, but there&apos;s a certain peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can help others.&#10;Reach out to other people more and make sure they are okay and offer a shoulder and an ear if they need one.

I also learned that some encouraging words can mean a lot even when they come from a complete stranger.&#10;If I was going to write some more letters like these ones I would probable end the letters.

"This year, and this semester, I have had a lot on my plate. I play competitive soccer for a club, I have a course-load of 5 AP classes, I have a part-time job, and I also try to maintain a good sleep schedule, and social life. However, as I&apos;m sure you can imagine, this is extremely difficult and I am not able to do all of this most of the time. Recently I have made the decision to quit my part time job because I feel as though that is the best decision, and the thing that I would be most ok with leaving my life. My high school soccer season is starting up in a few weeks as well, and I just didn&apos;t see how doing everything would be possible, while still remaining healthy and happy.&#10;This was a hard decision because it involved a lot of stress and thinking about it. I am always stressed and exhausted so I knew this was the best decision, it was just hard because it almost feels like I am giving up, or quitting on something because I can&apos;t take it, but there is only so much one person can do and take.&#10;After months of being miserable I finally reevaluated my situation and the things in my life that could be negatively impacting it. I decided which option was best for me and how I would be able to have more time, be less stressed, and just be happier and healthier overall.&#10;I learned that it is ok to admit that you need a break, or make changes in your life for the better. It doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re weak or can&apos;t handle things, it just means you know your limits and can decide to do what is best for you.&#10;I would have done this so much earlier because I am already feeling less stressed and happier, and I know that I could have done this so much easier and not had to have been so miserable for so long.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I am moving away to my dads house this summer to live and work there for me so I can live a better finacially stable life and not spend money on things like I do now as a teenager going out everynight . But i have had a girlfriend for almost 4 years now and she can only go to collage in colorado because that is the only place her parents will pay for her to go because they dont want her moving. So i took the action to say how about she goes to community collage for 2 years and then can decide where she want to go for the rest when shes older and can move where she wants. The conflic was that I felt that her going to collage here for four year would break us apart and we will never see eachother againg burt I took the steps to plan out calendar dates to come back and see her and my family and she can fly in as much as she wants and we both thought she will beable to move in two years.&#10;I felt like i was givng up the live of my life i didnt know which to choose and what would make me more happier to live here with her or to make more money and live where I want on the lake with my dads pool and boats. I just felt torn because i owe my dad some years backj from my mom not letting him see much when I was little.&#10;I made sure to just stick with my gut feeling and not to listen to anyone else and think long term, I figured that a girlfriend always comes and goes but being poor and rich does and I dont want to be poor or homeless because then there no girlfriend or house or anything so i chose that moving will be the best.&#10;That if it is true love or the love is there they will always find you in the end.

I also rehearsed what I would say, how to enter into group, and how to keep everyone on topic and on time.&#10;I learned that speaking in front of a group is a lot harder than it seems. I practiced and was prepared to make my experience better but I definitely didn&apos;t take it lightly.&#10;I would like to do it with a group that I am not familiar with at all.

But I felt relieved after I made the purchase, and that I chose the right option.&#10;I stacked up the pros and cons, looked at reviews, consulted family members, and decided on a choice.&#10;Even though I wanted the pencils, I needed the planner, as without a planner, I would have been a lot more unorganized when it came to deciding which classwork to do, when.&#10;If I could do it again, I would just immediately buy the planner to save myself some time.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It feels hard to talk about how I am feeling, and how I felt. But slowly I&apos;m doing what needs to be done.&#10;I wouldn&apos;t do anything else because I wouldn&apos;t know what else to say.

When this new girl looked stressed and didn&apos;t know what to do I asked if she needed any help and she said yeah so I decided to stop what I was doing to help and then after she was okay I went back to what I was supposed to be doing&#10;My thoughts went back to when I first started and how stressed I was and how confused I was. So I kinda related to her a lot.&#10;I decided to stop what i was doing and help her and help with the customers who were mad.&#10;I learned that it is nice to be able to help others.&#10;I wouldn&apos;t really do anything differently.

"I&apos;ve recently met someone in need of some level of support, and have tried a bit to be supportive.&#10;I&apos;ve been a bit worried about this person, but not enough to let it bother me much. I&apos;ve pretty much just used my amateur therapist skills to try and get them into a better mindset. They obviously don&apos;t want help, a lot of people in bad places don&apos;t. They don&apos;t think they deserve help. By trying to help convince them that it would be worth it, I&apos;ve begun the first step toward them getting a whole lot better.&#10;A lot of casually hanging out over games and occasionally having serious talks. I&apos;m trying to establish an environment of safety and trust online, so that they are more willing to work through their issues with me.&#10;While I have a long way to go in the world of psych, I&apos;ve realized that I as a person feel a need to help others in order to be complete myself, and that working in psychology is certainly going to be my best way I could help other people.&#10;While I have exhibited some frustration, I don&apos;t think it was to enough of an amount that I&apos;d have to regret it.

"Well around a week or two ago I wanted to relearn Japanese since I had taken it up until my senior year of high school when the pandemic forced us to isolate and when I signed up for online schooling they didn&apos;t have a Japanese class so I kinda just dropped it for a while until like 2 weeks ago&#10;I felt bummed out that I had just up and dropped something that was fun to do and was a pretty useful skill. I saw someone doing a livestream of them learning Japanese so I was like ""Eh fuck it, this could be fun"".&#10;I reinstalled a language learning app called ""Duolingo"" the app with the little bird. Everyday I do 5-10 minutes of practice to better learn the language.&#10;I learned the Japanese is pretty complex and I need to work on my kanji.

"I applied to 2 different community colleges a couple days ago and finally heard back from them!&#10;I was a little stressed because it was my first time sending in college apps even if it was only for community college. I was happy when I got my acceptance emails from both schools afterwards.&#10;I didn&apos;t panic, I knew I had a very high chance of getting in so I told my self not to worry.

"My family went to the mile high flea market where we were walking around looking at the vendors and soon we find this vendor selling this 2 player arcade style fight pad system with around 3100 games (believe that as you will). The plug and play system had a bunch of fighting games that I loved, some that I have wanted to play, and some I had never even heard of so this was perfect for me. The only problem was the price, it was like $170 so I have to save up for a while now.&#10;When I saw the fight pad I was like ""Hey this looks cool"" and when I saw what games it had I was astounded. When I looked at the price I was sad that yet I was committed to saving up for it.&#10;I played around on the system for a bit and it felt good so I thought this would be a good purchase. At first I wanted to try to pool money with my little brother and my dad but we didn&apos;t have enough money.&#10;I learned to start a rainy day fund for random things that I may need or may suddenly want. I also learned that if I can&apos;t afford anything right away then I will need to save up for things I want and hopefully it is still there by the time I have enough money and if not, eh, I can just try to see if I could find it online.&#10;I would have saved up money had I known it had existed.

Recently I have started buying lunch for my brother and I from Jimmy John&apos;s or somewhere similar.

"Once more a routine occurrence in the dearth of notable ""experiences"" in this quarantine, I have routinely practiced violin since my middle school years.&#10;Violin was an interesting struggle for me-with the instrument so close to the ear, one hears a much different rendition of the music compared to the spectator. A similar dynamic can be observed with art, and overall this lead to a pondering nature of both things in relation to self-perception and self-worth.&#10;I aim to practice every day for approximately 15 to 30 minutes, with a formal lesson every Sunday. Every few months I&apos;d prepare a piece for recital.&#10;Recently, my violin teacher came to me with the admission that he believes there is little else he can teach me, the violin not being his specialty. Because of this, he is recommending me to a colleague more experienced with the instrument. I am sad to part with him because of the rapport we have built over these years, but am gladdened by this mark of my progress.&#10;Over the years, and most especially in this motivation-sapping quarantine, I have been remiss in actually practicing every day.

Setting the appointment took awhile especially since they didn&apos;t call back, and then were late.&#10;Well turns out the the water heater was already dying when we moved here since the water pressure is way better now. I also learned that a water heater has an average life span of 8-12 years which is pretty cool.&#10;I probably would have had my mom call them sooner.

"In my first semester of my senior year I did not did so well on my clases, this led to have a lot of stress because I was over thinking.

After this I feelt with so much energy to continue with my journey.&#10;The actions that I took were to ask for help, talk to someone about my conflict, and start working to make up my mistakes.&#10;What I learned was that if you ask for help there will be always someone that could potentially help me, in the other hand if I do not ask for help this would just be a ball of snow that its going to keep getting biger and biger, to the point of making me feel like if I  were drowning.&#10;What I would do differently will be to ask for hel sooner and don&apos;t think that I am alone on this.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I did my family&apos;s laundry and washed everybody&apos;s towels, including the ones in the kitchen. I noticed that everyone was a little stressed , that the laundry was piling up. So I decided to do the laundry for everyone just to take one task of their hands. I think it helped my mom and sister with their stress from this week.&#10;My experience was waking up early, going through the house and getting everyones laundry, and spending my day doing multiple loads of laundry. I also put away all the laundry afterwards. I also felt better that my family was relieved that they had one less thing to worry about.&#10;I woke up early, looked around the house for laundry and towels, and sorted everything into categories to wash together. I went through the pockets of clothes to make sure there wasn&apos;t anything left in pockets (which there typically is). I did about 4 or 5 loads of laundry, organized everything into piles determining where they belong, and then brought them to each room and put them away.&#10;From this experience, I learned that even doing little things will make someone feel so much better and give them ease. I also learned that you should air dry certain pieces of clothing rather than tossing them in the dryer.&#10;Something I would do differently is asking them what they needed help with rather than assuming. I know that I did end up helping, but I know I didn&apos;t help in the most efficient way. Laundry isn&apos;t the worst of their issues. But next time, I will do something that will be considered useful to everyone.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the beginning of the school year I used to get distracted very easily on my phone or when I&apos;m doing stuff on the computer besides school. so some time passes by and there was one morning where I didn&apos;t go on my phone too many times and I got my work done faster and focused more which made me take control of my self awareness at school and get things done.&#10;being off my phone also helped the amount of work and how I did certain assignments get better grades because I focused more on work than on my phone.&#10;I completely closed my mind off of my phone when I was working in school.

The other day at work we had been really busy. Everybody had so much to do and it was getting hard to finish everything individually. I decided to help some of my coworkers finish their things because mine was not taking as long. It offered some relief to them which made me feel a lot better.

It was stressing them out a lot and I was glad that I was able to make it more manageable for them.&#10;I helped them with their zones. I helped them to finish with their metros and their z-racks. This took a lot of the stress away from them as truck is usually the thing that takes the longest.&#10;I learned that everybody needs help sometimes and that if you help others that they will help you back.

"With finals coming up this week, I have gone through each of my classes and decided which ones I need to do the best on, in order to do good in the class. This has helped me focus my studying to ensure that I get all As once the semester is over.&#10;This has helped me to be less stressed because most of my classes I know I won&apos;t have any problems in, so it allows me to spend more time on the classes that I know I need the most help in. Doing this has allowed me to manage my time better and feel a lot more prepared for the exams coming up.&#10;I started by figuring out what each class&apos;s final would consist of, whether multiple choice, free response, essay, etc. Then, I looked at my grades in each class and what types of scores I would need to satisfy the grade I wanted. I then figured out which classes I was understanding well, and which ones I was struggling in in understanding the material. I took all of these into consideration and decided which classes I should prioritize in my studying, and which ones I didn&apos;t need to worry too much about.&#10;I learned that this is a good way to study as it really gives me a lot of time to focus on the things I need to be focussing on. For example, I really understand what I&apos;m learning in AP psychology right now, have a pretty high grade, and the test is all multiple choice. Because of this I am not going to spend that much time studying for that test. However, for my AP computer science test, I have been struggling a little bit in there, I have a lower A in that class, and the test has both multiple choice questions and free response. Because of this, I am definitely going to be spending quite a bit time studying for that exam.&#10;The only thing that I would do differently is start doing this earlier, in past years of high school, because I think its a really effective way of studying and takes a lot of stress off of me.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I felt more confident in myself in middle school so I tried working harder.

I got into reading again and I read 2 books in 3 days, instead of working on my homework and taking care of things I have to do.&#10;Each day I will plan out what I want to do and I will take steps to complete whatever I wrote down for the day.

"Over the past few months I have been trying to go to bed earlier because if I don&apos;t, I wake up feeling really tired and with a headache. Going to bed earlier has helped me feel better during the day and allow me to get more schoolwork done so that I am less stressed.&#10;This has been going really good, and I have definitely been able to get more sleep, and even be able to wake up earlier with no problem, which is something I struggled with before I started to do this.&#10;I started by waking up a little bit earlier each day so that by nighttime, I would be more tired than normal, which allowed me to fall asleep earlier. I tried to keep a constant pattern of going to bed at relatively the same time each night, and waking up at the same time to allow my sleep patterns to adjust to this which would allow me to wake up easier.&#10;I learned that having a regular sleep pattern and getting a lot of sleep is very important and beneficial.

"I had finally been able to go out to a mall (wearing a mask and social distancing of course).

I was constantly in my own head at home so that break was really needed.&#10;My experience was good. I felt myself get more relaxed when I was able to leave home for a bit, and I got to spend quality time with my mom, and talk to workers at Sephora and talk about makeup (one of my favorite hobbies). It was a well deserved break for my mind.&#10;I left with my mom to her job (she is a CNA for my uncle).I helped out at her job.&#10;We went to the mall once she was done with work.We went to a couple stores but mostly went to Sephora to look and talk!&#10;I learned to remember to take care of your mental health.

"Had an enlightening conversation between friends regarding views on everything from religion, to transgender identities, to capitalism&apos;s ill effects on industry.&#10;Mixed. I was delighted to find that my friends, who I took for average, unaware ""gamers"" and harmless, if ignorant, high schoolers had a great deal of tolerance for transgender identities, though the conversation hit a rough spot with regard to transgender athletes, where two notable stances were ""the one time [he] could see transphobia being warranted"" (is it ever?) to ""I mean, it&apos;s rough but like..."" (i.e indifference). To their point, it&apos;s a difficult situation, but I will admit their ""solutions"" aggravated me.&#10;Argued on behalf of transgender athletes, pointing out that restrictions based on testosterone levels harm cisgender athletes in equal measure (e.g the case of Caster Semenya), but the consensus ultimately arrived at boiled down to the frustratingly resigned position that, since the affected persons remained few in number, there was little point in accommodation. Also attempted to guide a friend-himself a stringent atheist-through adjusting his condescending diction towards religious practitioners, though his social anxiety prevented the conversation reaching a point I was satisfied with.&#10;Discourse, while unpleasant, is necessary to better consider and improve one&apos;s own views-for instance, while I still believe that transgender athletes are unfairly treated, the conversation yielded some ""food for thought."" I&apos;ve also been given a new dilemma to consider-how to help a person who struggles with ""filter"". The aforementioned atheist has demonstrated on repeated occasions a propensity for immediately, and often rudely, speaking his mind-to his later shameful regret and self-flagellation. His tendency to immediately and nonverbally ""shut down"" during these moments of self loathing, and the frequency at which they occur, make guidance difficult, and, as of now, pending.&#10;Had I not been preoccupied in the occasion, I would have liked to better research the matter of transgender athleticism, as it is a subject in which I&apos;m relatively unacquainted.

"I was playing one of my favorite games and I had started to become rather frustrated with what was going on before me.&#10;I was playing an online game and there was an unbalance between the two teams. The other team had an instant advantage over ours that they were fully taking advantage of.&#10;When I felt my frustration starting to grow exponentially, instead of taking that anger out around me, I was able to mellow it.

"A few weeks ago, I was playing my second to last game of soccer I would ever play in my club career. Me and another girl from the opposing team went up for the ball and we both fell. She landed on my leg and I was unable to walk on it. I had to go to the ER that day and they did x-rays. I couldn&apos;t finish the game, and our last game of the season was the next day, which I couldn&apos;t play either. Playing since I was 4 years old, it was really hard not to be able to play my last 2 games, but I knew I had no control over it.&#10;This was something that I had feared of happening ever since I started playing. For it to happen on my last few games is saddening, but at least I got to play the hundreds of other games.

I began finding inspiration, researching new techniques and brainstormed some projects I would like to start. This was all in an attempt to bounce back from the icky place I was in.&#10;I began finding inspiration, researching new techniques and brainstormed some projects I would like to start. This was all in an attempt to bounce back from the icky place I was in.&#10;I learned that when things get tough, you have to push past them. If you fall you have to get back up or you&apos;ll miss out on the opportunities you could&apos;ve experienced if you wouldn&apos;t have stayed on the ground. I also learned that when insecurities pop up, you have to push past them and remind yourself of what matters and the successes you have already achieved.&#10;Next time I feel icky I will try to be more cognizant of it and make sure that I am staying inspired and that I don&apos;t get too hard on myself. A big thing for me to remember is that nothing worth having comes easy, and that skills take time to cultivate.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Working out a lot. . .etc.&#10;That you can not change in one day, it takes time it&apos;s a process.&#10;I fell off my wagon for quiet some time and I think I just need to stay in my routine and not get distracted with other things",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I got frustrated at my school work and I had to leave and try it again with a fresh mind set. I felt entitled to complete the problem so I ask for help by my sister and she helped me understand what I was doing wrong and how to fix it.&#10;I was struggling with my math homework and I needed help so my sister decided to show me an easier and more understanding way of doing the problem. This new way made it easier to understand and follow through with my work.&#10;I used others knowledge to understand the problem. I also left and came back to it when I was thinking more clear.&#10;I learned that asking people for support is better than doing it on your own with no greater knowledge. I also found out that instead of just struggling you just need to leave the problem and move on or physically leave to have a fresh mind set.&#10;I would also ask my teacher for help because she would know best. I also have my advisory teacher for sup[port when I need it.,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"With all the chaos caused by covid, I knew that in-person school would be just as problematic and would most likely cause a lot of inconsistency in my life. I had never done online school, and before everything with covid happened, I would never have even thought about doing online school. I decided to give it a chance, even though I was a stranger to it.&#10;Online school has been really good for me. With everything around me being so overwhelming and full of uncertainty, online school has been something I have been able to organize, and figure out for myself. It keeps me busy while still being productive, and, most of all, brings constancy into my life. Like I said, I knew in-person school would bring more uncertainty and inconsistency into my life, with everything around me constantly changing, but online school has been something static, something that I have been able to change and evolve around, while it still remains the same and solid.&#10;This was actually a really hard decision to make. At first, I was so sure I would be doing in-person school, I barely even gave any thought to it. Then, some time passed and it the thought of online school kept coming into my head, it was like I was subconsciously trying to tell myself to do it. I thought about it a little longer, and the more I did, I realized that this was going to be the rock in my life that I needed. While there were downsides, like not being able to see my friends at school, and never being able to go back to my home school, and basically missing out on my senior year, I decided to take the risk and try it out. Obviously it has worked out, but at the time I wasn&apos;t sure of that, and, keeping an open mind, it paid off.&#10;I learned that not every decision in life should be made immediately. That taking the time to think through something is important to figure out what is best for you. I learned that even something you never would think of doing could be a good thing. Like I said, I never ever would have done online school if it wasn&apos;t for covid, but it turns out I really like it! I learned that keeping an open mind to things can allow you to discover things that you actually love. I really enjoy online school, and I never would have discovered that if I didn&apos;t give it a chance with an open-mind.&#10;While I loved in person school when things were normal, who knows, maybe I would have loved online school back then as much as I do now. I would be more open to other education options, like online school, instead of just doing normal school. I never even thought of online school as an option, but now I would definitely make sure that I kept that as an idea.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Currently negotiating a difficult family situation as my mother recently had no choice but to move out after finding out that her then-fiance had dealt-and is dealing-with lifelong substance abuse, with no present plans to affect permanent change.

I did not have a strong emotional attachment to this man nor the house from which we were moving, as I had only known both for a couple years. However I did worry for my mother-her strong emotional reaction to this was primarily owing to her own upbringing among parents who coped with addiction, and her tendency to forcibly put other&apos;s needs before her own as a coping mechanism under stress. The aforementioned discussions-in which I assured her the needs of myself and my sister were met and that she should concern herself with her own-were the means by which I expressed, and dealt with, my own concern.&#10;Primarily, the aforementioned discussions were my actions, though I also offered my presence when she ultimately decided to break the news to my sister and father, though my mother declined.&#10;Sometimes there is little you can do to physically help a person with their problems (i.e ""solve"" them), but a lent ear and even simply the offer of support can be succor enough.&#10;Perhaps involve myself more in my mother&apos;s household should she choose to begin dating again.

I learned how to operate a hand-powered forklift.&#10;I would invite more community members to help us in the effort and also extend the experience up and down the chain from food procurement to food delivery.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was working with a student and found that she was suffering from Flu like symptoms. She was worried that she had the coronavirus symptoms. I recommended that she go to the doctor.&#10;I made a statement saying that she should take it lightly. In my opinion I was trying to help her understand that this is a serious illness. However she took offense from the statement. It really surprised me.&#10;I immediately wrote back to her saying that I did not mean to undermine her efforts. Instead I was trying to show My genuine concern for her.&#10;I learned that written communication can be tricky and sometimes sentiments don&apos;t get communicated the way you mean them to be.&#10;I would be very careful about my written words and written communication.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A peer in my class that I have known for a while has recently decided to cut her self in class. My friend and I went to an adult and talked to them. When I see her reach for scissors  for a purpose it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t serve I go to her and offer to get her ice to chew on or take her to see Kara.&#10;I felt scared and went to someone I trusted to help me with the situation so I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t alone. After I got her help with what she needed I felt a weight off my shoulder and like I could breathe again. I also felt like I saved her life in a way.&#10;Told my friend that the peer trusted more and we went together to clean her up and get her arm bandaged. We took her to the office to talk to a trusted adult of hers and came up with a solution and a working process into excluding self harm to express her feelings.&#10;I learned to treat people that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the way you treat your friends, and to help others that need the helping guidance because it could lead to problems that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t your fault but that may lead you to feel guilty about it.&#10;I would probably still get her washed up and bandaged but I would have gotten an adult instead of trying to talk to her myself and than getting an adult that she trusted to talk to.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My friend and I were going to skate city. We brought along her brothers but had to turn back to drop them off because they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being nice to each other. We had a chat with my friends parents about what happened and my friend was clearly annoyed. On our way to skate city I talked to her about how she still loves her brothers even if they annoy her. I also told her being that she is the oldest that she does not have to be their parent and force them to behave. I told her to process through it and let me know how she is feeling. She let me know later that it was very helpful.&#10;I was able to be an observer to the situation and be non biased about the events. I was also able to help my friend work through her frustration.&#10;First of I observed and I processed through it. Once I had determined what I saw and what my friend most needed to hear, I shared the information in hopes of starting to resolve the issue.&#10;I learned that processing something first often leads to a better outcome. I also learned how annoying younger brothers can be.&#10;I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think of anything now even though I am sure I will later.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
As a senior I decided to create a leadership group for my youth group. I talked with my youth pastor who agrees with my idea and I have talked with several people who I think would be great leaders who said they would love to join&#10;My experience was getting to implement something that I feel will be very beneficial for our group. I see it as a way or group can be more student oriented&#10;I first devised what this would have a student leadership would mean and how it would happen. Next I shared this idea with our youth pastor and how we could make it a reality. Finally I went to my fellow students to see who would want to be a leader.&#10;I learned that if you have a well prepared plan that is still open to new ideas you are more likely to be successful. Also that people want leadership no matter where it is or if they are that leader.&#10;If I could have I would have tried to implement this sooner so that I could have been apart of it before I graduated.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first time I was able to get a real job I new it would take a lot of responsibility.&#10;When I turned 16 I began to work at my parents office because I knew that I needed to start making money as soon as possible.&#10;This was a bit easier to get because my parents ran it.  But I was still determined to do my best.&#10;I think that getting a job was the best learning experience because it introduces you to what life is like.&#10;I don&apos;t think I would do anything differently.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am currently trying to get into better shape.

I knew something had to change with the way we were operating and I decided to act on it.&#10;I told the other employee there with me that something needed to change and so we did just that. We changed the way we were making and focused on preparing for the next order after the next. We were swapping from prepping the bag while the other makes the order at hand and once one of us was done prepping the bags then we would start on thee next order and once he took his order to his destination he would prep the bag for my order and this was the cycle we repeated until we were finished for the day.&#10;I learned that communication is vital for any given situation and should be used a lot more frequently in our everyday lives for even the simplest of things. That short exchange of words between my fellow employee and I launched us forward in progress faster than what we were doing before.&#10;I would have decided to act sooner before the rush happened, in doing so would have prevented my fellow employee and I from getting rushed down in the first place.

"I have been volunteering at Lutheran Medical Center for around 6-7 months now, and have generally helped with lots of smaller tasks as well as larger projects.&#10;I have done the activity cart in which you go around a couple floors of the hospital and ask people if they would like any magazines, crossword puzzles, cards, and/or books.

I have also learned that when people are at the hospital, they are likely not there for a particularly good reason, and seeing a smiling face that is happy to help them can definitely make people feel better, and much more welcome.&#10;I don&apos;t think that I would do anything differently because I have always done my best to be helpful and contribute as much as I can to my work at the hospital.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
